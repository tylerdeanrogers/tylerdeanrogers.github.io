<!-- START PROBLEM -->
	<section class="about">
		<div class="column padding">
			<h4 class="dark left">The Problem:</h4>
			<p class="left">This problem is really twofold: First, the <a href="http://dailyemerald.com">Emerald Media Group</a> is an independent news group on campus that has produced the school newspaper for over 100 years. As print readership declined the organization needed new revenue streams to support the paper as it transitioned to a digital first platform. Second, many local businesses in Eugene rely on the unversity student demographic in order to stay viable, but many owners and marketing professionals struggle to stay on top of trends and technolgy.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column padding">
			<h4 class="dark left">The Solution:</h4>
			<p class="left"><a href="http://venturedept.com">The Venture Dept.</a> was born in 2013. The first independent, student-run creative agency specializing in video production, design, web development and social media. What started as a few students with one client grew into an 18 person agency with annual billables over 70k. In just two years weâ€™ve helped over 25 small businesses and university departments connect with students in ways simply not possible only a few years prior.</p>

			<h4 class="dark left">Website</h4>
			<p class="left">I definitely learned my lesson building this bad boy. In the future I don't think I would build a site this big without a CMS. It was a great learning experience and I made hundreds of mistakes, but overall this project was incredibly eye opening. You should <a href="http://venturedept.com">take a look around</a> and check out some of the work the team has produced.</p>

<section class="about">
		<div class="column padding">
			<h4 class="dark left">Client: UO Architecture and Allied Arts</h4>
			<p class="left">The University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts was founded in 1914 and is a national leader in architecture, the arts, planning, policy, and design. The school celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2014 and asked the Venture Dept. to create a video that embodied the rich history while also celebrating the future. Two of the most tallented people I know made this possible: <a href="http://grant-lemons.com">Grant Lemons</a> shot, edited and animated, and <a href="http://monicasagowitz.com">Monica Sagowitz</a> wrote the script.</p>

			<h4 class="dark left">Client: Ducks Village</h4>
			<p class="left">A student housing complex in Eugene asked the Venture Dept. to produce a few videos that highlighted the property and the amenities. It's a little further off campus than many of the student complexes, but it offers a lot more space and a few rare amenties that are unheard of in Eugene (a pool). The incredibly tallented <a href="http://kathrynboydbatstone.com">Kathryn Boyd-Batstone</a> filmed and edited.</p>
