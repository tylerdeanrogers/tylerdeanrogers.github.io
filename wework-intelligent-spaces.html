          <p class="mt0-ns fw3 mt2 f2-l f3-ns f4 lh-copy">I joined WeWork as a Product Designer on July 24, 2017 by invitation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keatonprice/" class="washed-red">Keaton Price<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a>. When I started the design team was roughly 15 people. In my first 20 months with the company I helped design the most used features on our member facing technology platform: Rooms, Guests, and Desks. While the product, engineering and design teams expanded during hypergrowth, I was the primary source of design knowledge on our team. I was managed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenbonna/" class="washed-red">Karen Bonna Rainert<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshabrams/" class="washed-red">Josh Abrams<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> <br><br>My most meaningful contribution to users came from the redesign of the iOS app where I was responsible for designing Space, Rooms, Desks, Guests, and Building Guide. In my time at WeWork I grew tremendously as a designer and employee of one of the most controversial unicorns to ever exist.</p>

          <b>Execution</b><br><br>Helped lead the iOS redesign effort for 3 engineering squads with ~19 engineers: Meeting and Booking, Guest Experience and Workspace. <br><br>Participated in 5+ unique design sprints for Welkio Access, Guest Experience, End to End Meetings, Printing, and Space. In design sprints I played an active role in helping engineers and product people learn design thinking techniques. <br><br>After finding that almost 40% of room reservations made on the WeWork app were made within an hour of the meeting's start time, I recommended and designed the "Open Rooms" feature to show rooms that are available within the next 30 minutes at a user's location on the space tab. This allows members to find an available room without entering into the traditional room booking flow. On average we have found that room bookings made with the open rooms feature are 21 seconds faster (saving our members valuable time on this repetitive task). <br><br>Participated in 25+ user interviews and usability tests with our research team. Adapting designs and prototypes in real-time and distilling learnings into actionable tasks.

          <b>Teamwork</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Worked with our research team, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-hey/" class="washed-red">David Hey<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylafarrell/" class="washed-red">Kayla Farrell<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> to clarify their findings and turn them into actionable experience principles.</li>
            <li>Worked with an amazing product manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrdecker/" class="washed-red">Jordan Decker<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> to prioritize and ship work.</li>
            <li>Built a design relationship with roughly 20 engineers, which has since blossomed into friendships and trusted working relationships as our technology team grows. Engineers feel comfortable coming to me with questions and as a result I helped break down the walls between the different functions on our team.</li>
            <li>I constantly pushed my team to scrutinize why we’re building the products we do and who they serve. As a result I earned my team’s trust and consequently we built more focused features with greater impact.</li>
            <li>I participated in WeWork’s first Test Connection group, led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshmi-rengarajan-077b3aa/" class="washed-red">Lakshmi Rengarajan<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a>. I was one of 15 cross-functional employees selected to test out new ideas centered around radical empathy and connection. Her work was presented at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbp_3XfKiIw" class="washed-red">Global Summit 2019<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a>. I was the sole representative for technology and design in the group and helped build relationships and connections across the company at large.</li>

          <b>Leadership</b><br><br>
          I created Homeroom—a grassroots effort to connect our team beyond work. With the help of my design colleague, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deenaedwards/" class="washed-red">Deena Edwards<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> I set up a framework for our entire team, including remote offices to be present and involved in a casual setting.<br><br>

          As the most consistent product design presence on the Intelligent Spaces team, I earned respect amongst my partners as a valuable advocate for design and the end user. This is especially evident in design sprints with cross-functional teams.</p>
