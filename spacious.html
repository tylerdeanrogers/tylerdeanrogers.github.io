          <p class="mt0-ns fw3 mt2 f2-l f3-ns f4 lh-copy">In August 2019, WeWork acquired the rival co-working business, Spacious. The three-year-old, New York-based startup turned restaurants that sit empty during the day into co-working spaces. Spacious was co-founded in 2016 by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prestonpesek/" class="link washed-red hover-bg-white-60 bb">Preston Pesek<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> whose background is in commercial real estate.<br><br>The company’s goal was to take advantage of under-utilized urban spaces, including abandoned retail stores and empty restaurants, to serve the co-working crowd.<br><br>I was the lead designer tasked with adopting the Spacious technology into the WeWork stack and quickly ramping up product experiments.</p>

          <b>Execution</b><br><br>I started by doing an audit of the existing Spacious tech, meeting and observing their users, and becoming friends with the VP of Engineering, Alex Tollefsen. They had a loyal group of users and a solid product. The mobile apps were React Native and the web app was React. <br><br>The key differentiator between Spacious and other “on-demand” coworking was the low price and the ability to use the spaces without a mobile app or lengthy account setups.

          <b>Teamwork</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Worked with our research team, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-hey/" class="washed-red">David Hey<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylafarrell/" class="washed-red">Kayla Farrell<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> to clarify their findings and turn them into actionable experience principles.</li>
            <li>Worked with an amazing product manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrdecker/" class="washed-red">Jordan Decker<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> to prioritize and ship work.</li>
            <li>Built a design relationship with roughly 20 engineers, which has since blossomed into friendships and trusted working relationships as our technology team grows. Engineers feel comfortable coming to me with questions and as a result I helped break down the walls between the different functions on our team.</li>
            <li>I constantly pushed my team to scrutinize why we’re building the products we do and who they serve. As a result I earned my team’s trust and consequently we built more focused features with greater impact.</li>
            <li>I participated in WeWork’s first Test Connection group, led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshmi-rengarajan-077b3aa/" class="washed-red">Lakshmi Rengarajan<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a>. I was one of 15 cross-functional employees selected to test out new ideas centered around radical empathy and connection. Her work was presented at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbp_3XfKiIw" class="washed-red">Global Summit 2019<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a>. I was the sole representative for technology and design in the group and helped build relationships and connections across the company at large.</li>

          <b>Leadership</b><br><br>
          I created Homeroom—a grassroots effort to connect our team beyond work. With the help of my design colleague, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deenaedwards/" class="washed-red">Deena Edwards<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-arrow-top-right"></span></a> I set up a framework for our entire team, including remote offices to be present and involved in a casual setting.<br><br>

          As the most consistent product design presence on the Intelligent Spaces team, I earned respect amongst my partners as a valuable advocate for design and the end user. This is especially evident in design sprints with cross-functional teams.</p>
