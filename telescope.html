			<h4 class="dark left">The Problem:</h4>
			<p class="left">The University of Oregon is incredibly segregated in terms of majors and disciplines. Unfortunately, this isn’t conducive to cross-collaboration between the more technical majors and the more visual ones. Simultaneously, many students lack basic science literacy across all disciplines, but especially astronomy. As such an inherently visual science, people have been fascinated by the stars as long as history documents, but many people still don’t understand the three basics of astronomy: time, motion and scale.</p>

			<h4 class="dark left">The Solution:</h4>
			<p class="left">Venture Labs: Telescope. Telescope is a four-day long student competition, where ten teams of five students each, with a range of expertises (web development, design, business, research, video production, etc.) compete to solve a prompt. The event was organized, planned, and created by students with three goals in mind. 1. Increase science literacy on campus. 2. Kickstart cross-discipline collaboration between students that continues to expand long after Telescope. 3. Make some incredible stuff.</p>

			<h4 class="dark left">Client: UO Architecture and Allied Arts</h4>
			<p class="left">The University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts was founded in 1914 and is a national leader in architecture, the arts, planning, policy, and design. The school celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2014 and asked the Venture Dept. to create a video that embodied the rich history while also celebrating the future. Two of the most tallented people I know made this possible: <a href="http://grant-lemons.com">Grant Lemons</a> shot, edited and animated, and <a href="http://monicasagowitz.com">Monica Sagowitz</a> wrote the script.</p>

			<h4 class="dark left">Ducks Village</h4>
			<p class="left">A student housing complex in Eugene asked the Venture Dept. to produce a few videos that highlighted the property and the amenities. It's a little further off campus than many of the student complexes, but it offers a lot more space and a few rare amenties that are unheard of in Eugene (a pool). The incredibly tallented <a href="kathrynboydbatstone.com">Kathryn Boyd-Batstone</a> filmed and edited.</p>
