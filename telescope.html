<!-- START PROBLEM -->
	<section class="about">
		<div class="column padding">
			<h4 class="dark left">The Problem:</h4>
			<p class="left">The University of Oregon is incredibly segregated in terms of majors and disciplines. Unfortunately, this isn’t conducive to cross-collaboration between the more technical majors and the more visual ones. Simultaneously, many students lack basic science literacy across all disciplines, but especially astronomy. As such an inherently visual science, people have been fascinated by the stars as long as history documents, but many people still don’t understand the three basics of astronomy: time, motion and scale.</p>

		<div class="column padding">
			<h4 class="dark left">The Solution:</h4>
			<p class="left">Venture Labs: Telescope. Telescope is a four-day long student competition, where ten teams of five students each, with a range of expertises (web development, design, business, research, video production, etc.) compete to solve a prompt. The event was organized, planned, and created by the <a href="http://venturedept.com">Venture Dept.</a> led by <a href="http://monicasagowitz.com">Monica Sagowitz</a> and me with three goals in mind. 1. Increase science literacy on campus. 2. Kickstart cross-discipline collaboration between students that continues to expand long after Telescope. 3. Make some incredible stuff.</p>

			<h4 class="dark left">Website:</h4>
			<p class="left">This project is expansive and my role extends much further than design. If you're interested I'd love to <a href="mailto:tdrogers7@gmail.com">talk more</a> about my roles as an event planner, fundraiser and creative director but for now I'll just stick to the UI/UX, frontend devlopment and art direction. For the site I decided to use Zurb's Foundation 5 framework. Before Telescope I had only used Bootstrap, but I'd read a lot about the new Foundation update and wanted to give it a try. I spent a few weeks organizing and creating the site's content with basic wireframes. After many iterations I decided on a single page layout rather than multiple pages. The visual design was a long process that went through many lives. Check out live <a href="http://labs.venturedept.com">site</a>.</p>

			<h4 class="dark left">Promotional Collateral:</h4>
			<p class="left">Promoting the event was its own huge task and wouldn't have been possible without some awesome work from the Venture team. <a href="http://spicewalker.com">Spice Walker</a>, <a href="http://marinolapidus.com">Marino Lapidus</a>, <a href="http://kimuong.com">Kim Uong</a> and <a href="http://spencerorofino.com">Spencer Orofino</a> did some great strategy work for social media and other potential channels. <a href="http://ryandutch.com">Ryan Dutch</a> did the invitation designs and social graphics as well as some art direction for the overarching event branding. <a href="http://rachellam.net/">Rachel Ellam</a> did the amazing video work.</p>
